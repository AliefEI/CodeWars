//Your function takes two arguments:

//current father's age (years)
//current age of his son (years)
//Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).

//param= dad's age and son's age
//return #years WHEN dad=2sonAge
//example 42/2-->21
